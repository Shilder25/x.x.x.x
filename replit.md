# TradingAgents Framework

## Overview
This project is a multi-LLM prediction market framework where five AI prediction agents (ChatGPT, Gemini, Qwen, Deepseek, Grok) compete autonomously on Opinion.trade (BNB Chain). Each agent analyzes financial market events using technical indicators, fundamental data, and sentiment analysis to generate probabilistic predictions for binary outcomes. The system tracks performance metrics (accuracy, Sharpe ratio, profit/loss), maintains virtual portfolios, and includes a sophisticated prompt system simulating a 7-role internal decision-making process within each LLM. The framework also features an autonomous prediction mode where AIs continuously adapt their strategies based on performance, aiming for continuous improvement rather than termination upon losses.

## Recent Changes (November 9, 2025)

**Multi-Category Analysis & Real Wallet Integration - Production Ready:**
- **Multi-Category Event Analysis**: Modified `autonomous_engine.py` to fetch events from all Opinion.trade categories (crypto, tech, markets, sports, politics, world, science, other) and analyze opportunities across categories rather than single category
- **All 5 LLM Clients Activated**: Integrated ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), Deepseek, Qwen, and Grok (XAI) with real API credentials, production-ready with error handling
- **Shared Wallet with Individual Tracking**: All AIs share a single wallet but are tracked individually via `metadata.firm_name` field in Opinion.trade bets; database schema includes firm_name column in `autonomous_bets` table
- **End-to-End Autonomous Cycles**: Implemented `run_daily_cycle()` that fetches real events from Opinion.trade API, generates predictions using real LLMs, and submits bets to Opinion.trade
- **Alpha Arena Dashboard - Real Data Integration**:
  - Replaced all simulated data with real database queries to `db.get_autonomous_bets()`
  - **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Corrected account value calculation from `initial + sum(profit_loss - bet_size) - sum(active)` to `initial + sum(profit_loss) - sum(active)`, eliminating double-subtraction that was showing losses as -2× stake
  - Proper formula: `account_value = initial_bankroll + sum(profit_loss for resolved) - sum(bet_size for active)`
  - Account values now accurately reflect BankrollManager state
- **POSITIONS View**: Replaced BLOG placeholder with bet tracking panel
  - Shows 4 summary metrics: Total Bets, Active, Resolved, Capital Locked
  - Two tabs: 🟢 ACTIVE and ✅ RESOLVED
  - ACTIVE: displays pending bets with AI name, category, bet size, probability, confidence
  - RESOLVED: displays completed bets with P&L, status (WON/LOST), resolution timestamp
  - Limited to 20 most recent per tab, sorted by execution timestamp descending
  - Empty state handling for no data scenarios
- **Automated Reconciliation System**:
  - Implemented `reconcile_bets()` in `autonomous_engine.py` that runs at end of each daily cycle
  - Fetches resolved events from Opinion.trade API
  - Updates database using `db.update_autonomous_bet_result()`
  - Syncs BankrollManager using `bankroll.record_result()`
  - Comprehensive error handling and logging for API failures
  - Returns reconciliation statistics (resolved_count, won, lost, total_pnl)
- **CSS Styling Fix**: Changed performance capsule borders from `border-left` to `box-shadow: inset 3px 0 0 {color}` for more reliable colored accent rendering in Streamlit
- **Navigation Update**: 4 views now are LIVE, LEADERBOARD, POSITIONS (replaces BLOG), MODELS
- **E2E Testing**: Full playwright test suite passed, validating all 4 dashboard views, navigation, data persistence, and correct account value calculations

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
The application uses Streamlit for a multi-tab web interface, configured with a wide layout. It uses session state for managing database connections, orchestrators, and cached data. There are seven main tabs: 'Nueva Predicción' (Generate predictions), 'Panel de Transparencia' (Detailed reasoning), 'Dashboard Comparativo' (Compare agent performance), 'Recomendaciones & Consenso' (Recommendation engine), 'Enviar a Opinion.trade' (Submit predictions), 'Registrar Resultados' (Track outcomes), and 'Competencia Autónoma' (Autonomous prediction competition dashboard).

### Backend Architecture
The backend employs a modular, service-oriented design. Key components include:
- **`TradingDatabase`**: An SQLite-based persistence layer for predictions, firm performance, and virtual portfolios with automatic schema migration.
- **`FirmOrchestrator`**: Manages LLM clients and prediction generation across firms.
- **Individual Firm Clients**: Encapsulate LLM-specific API interactions.
- **Data Collectors**: Specialized classes for technical, fundamental, and sentiment data.
- **Prompt System**: Generates structured prompts simulating a 7-role prediction agent decision-making process across three stages: Analysis & Synthesis, Bullish/Bearish Debate, and Risk Evaluation & Final Decision.
- **`RecommendationEngine`**: Analyzes historical performance for prediction recommendations.
- **`OpinionTradeAPI`**: Handles automated prediction submission.
- **`Autonomous Engine`**: Orchestrates daily prediction cycles for all IAs, including event analysis, risk-aware betting, and simulation/real mode toggling.
- **`Risk Management System`**: A multi-level adaptive system that never stops, but adapts strategies based on profit/loss thresholds (-0% to -9% normal, -10% to -19% tactical adjustment, -20% to -29% strategy change, -30%+ reinvention, +50% positive adaptation). It includes safety features like daily loss limits and category exposure limits.
- **`Bankroll Management`**: Assigns different betting strategies to each IA (Kelly Criterion, Modified Martingale, Fixed Fractional, Proportional, Anti-Martingale) to foster competitive diversity.
- **`Learning System`**: Provides continuous improvement through weekly performance analysis, including pattern recognition, category performance tracking, confidence calibration, and EV accuracy assessment, generating actionable recommendations.

### LLM Integration Architecture
A multi-provider approach supports different LLM APIs with built-in rate limiting (exponential backoff) and cost tracking. It leverages Replit's managed OpenAI integration for ChatGPT.

### Data Collection Architecture
A multi-source strategy uses specialized collectors: `AlphaVantageCollector` for technical indicators, `YFinanceCollector` for fundamental data, and `RedditSentimentCollector` for social sentiment analysis using VADER.

### Data Storage
An embedded SQLite database is used, with a schema designed for `predictions`, `firm_performance`, `virtual_portfolio`, `autonomous_bets`, `autonomous_cycles`, and `strategy_adaptations`. Automatic schema migration ensures backward compatibility.

### Visualization Layer
Plotly is used for interactive charts within Streamlit, including time series, performance dashboards, and portfolio visualizations.
